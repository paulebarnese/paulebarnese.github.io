            "Of course, that initial argument then gets mixed up with events that may arise as we move through the game, and that is that our protagonist can maintain adventures with other characters that appear, and that then leads to a staging necessarily very daring. In fact, this game is only recommended for people over the age of 18, which you will need to consider if you are sharing a cell phone or computer with a minor.What we particularly liked about Summertime Saga is that we do not necessarily have to follow a linear development of the adventure, on the contrary, we have the possibility of visiting the main sites of the city at our leisure. This allows us to have a level of interaction with people from all walks of life in a completely free way, performing all kinds of missions and participating in various events throughout the day In this regard, you should keep in mind that Summertime Saga will allow you to participate in a maximum of three events per day, so you will need to carefully analyze the events that you should not miss in any case. When the third event is over, it will be time for our character to go home and rest, to resume the next day.At the same time, our character has a series of essential skills or attributes, which we can improve as we progress in the game, and we have to analyze the characteristics that we consider important. For example, you can send the character to the gym to improve their physical condition, or you can do art activities to improve their charisma and connect with others Summertime Saga contains a plethora of storylines which in turn are integrated into the main storyline, so the more characters you meet, the richer your user experience becomes.The graphics of Summertime Saga are undoubtedly one of the main reasons why we could recommend downloading this game, indeed, for a free game, the quality of the graphics is very good. The characters and their interactions, as well as the storylines in which they evolve, are perfectly realized, so you will always have a sense of realism that is not always present in video game novels To keep in mind :As we said before, Summertime Saga is available in version for Windows and Android computers, so you can enjoy this entertainment proposition almost anywhere.The best Summertime Saga is characterized by a lot of good points, although if we were to take some of them, we should mostly be talking about its graphics and open gameplay, which is why we think it is almost unmatched in its niche. Also, being able to customize our character and shape him to look like what we are looking for is without a doubt one of his most remarkable qualities.The worst :While we did not find too many negative aspects of Summertime Saga, and in fact there are not any that are worth mentioning, as a major handicap of the game, we should not lose any as it is only recommended for people over 18 years old. While there is not any explicit adult content, we can still see innuendos and situations that suggest situations that should not be accessible to children.Evaluation :Summertime Saga is one of the best free visual novel options you can find these days, a game that surely makes many teenagers feel identified with their main character. If you want to take care of a protagonist who is going through many situations in your life, and add a touch of spice to your life, this is probably a title for you"
