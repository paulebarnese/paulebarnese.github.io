          "Play the stocks in Grand Theft Auto 5 and get maximum profit from Lester's Assassination Missions Playing the stock market is slightly intimidating, and can be risky for those unprepared, or out of the loop. Lester's Assassination Missions, on the other hand, can provide huge amounts of cash money after the GTA 5 story missions are done, with little to no risk. You won’t be judged for wanting more, or who you chose to get it"

          "If you want to show off your skills as a ruthless driver, then the GTA 5 stock car races are the perfect place to do it. To get started on them, you need to complete the Mr. Philips mission with Trevor, after which a marker will appear in the Grand Senora Desert near his main airstrip. What follows is a series of GTA 5 races, where you'll unlock a set of stock cars with subsequent pole positions, and your ultimate prize is the GTA 5 Cheval Marshall monster truck. To see all the rewards you can unlock and where to claim them, follow our GTA 5 stock car races guide and put the pedal to the metal . \n You'll need to find a suitable ride to enter the first race - a muscle or sports car should do it. Win races to unlock the following vehicles, in order : \n Burger Shot Stallion \n Redwood Gauntlet \n Pißwasser Dominator \n Sprunk Buffalo \n Cheval Marshall \n Once unlocked, you can access the four stock cars from any of the characters' personal garages \n You can also collect the Cheval Marshall from Trevor's airstrip hanger in Grand Senora Desert, with a set of 25 different flag liveries to choose from. Now get out there and cause some monster truck mayhem"

          "The GTA 5 Dodo seaplane is a very handy vehicle to have access to, as it combines the ability to fly (unlike its now extinct namesake) with being able to land anywhere on water, making rivers and lakes your new runways. If you want to add this to your transport options in GTA 5, then you'll first need to complete the Nervous Ron mission with Trevor. Once that's done, the GTA 5 Dodo seaplane will appear as a Random Event at a set location, and we've got all the details on how to find it in our guide below \n The Random Event is found in the sea cove east of Ron Alternatives Wind Farm. You'll need to approach on a boat or sea faring vehicle to trigger the event - jet skis are available from the beach a little further down the coast to the south \n Once the marker appears, head into the cove and shoot the gunmen in the boats before hopping into the Dodo \n As you leave the area two more boats of gunmen will attack, but you can simply fly away and leave them behind. Once completed, the Dodo seaplane will spawn in the following two locations \n At the dock on the small Vinewood Hills lake \n At the dock to the north of the Alamo Sea \n There’s also the option to buy the Dodo from the Elitas Travel website for a cool $500,000 once you’ve completed the Random Event"
