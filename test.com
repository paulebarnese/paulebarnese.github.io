          "Friday Night Funkin is a PC game that challenges your sense of rhythm. The game challenges you to press buttons at specific times: the screen shows which key you need to press, and the game rewards points for accuracy and pace. The mechanics are similar to that of the DDR, where you press the key when the floating arrow matches its shape (seen at the top of the screen). You play the role of the boyfriend, a boy with white skin and sky blue hair. He fights to get a kiss from his girlfriend, but his dad wont allow him to. The boyfriend must first be able to beat him in a singing test. Using your WASD or the arrow keys you will have to match each arrow as best as possible. The result of each round will be determined by the counter at the bottom of the screen"
