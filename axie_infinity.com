      "https://img.youtube.com/vi/4H7igOHGlp4/maxresdefault.jpg",
      "Scholars receive hundreds of similar messages every day, so it would be naive to expect a response.\nBesides, it's immediately clear to everyone that you're not going to waste your time learning about any scholarship, but want to get it in the easiest way possible.\nLittering comments is also not helpful to you, much less the people around you. It will only provoke rejection and possibly a ban.\nThere are much more effective ways (we'll talk about them later) to get what you want. Do not set yourself up for an easy battle, but for war. And the reward will be appropriate!"

      "https://img.youtube.com/vi/4H7igOHGlp4/maxresdefault.jpg",
      "Scholarships are given to those who deserve them, not beggars.\nWe don't want to sound insensitive, but no one is going to read the big messages about how you need to feed your family, pay your tuition, help your parents, etc., because that's just your problem.\nBesides, everyone will have similar stories (which, as you've probably noticed, are immediately described in the comments) and you'll once again stop standing out from the hundreds and thousands of others asking.\nDon't discount it, work at it, and you'll get results - guaranteed."

      "People don't like interacting with empty, anonymous accounts\nFill out information about yourself, you don't have to write out everything you can think of - write the basics: gender, age, maybe a profession or hobby, your personality traits.\nTry to be frank, these are the kind of people who inspire confidence!"

      "Find scholar managers",
      "https://img.youtube.com/vi/4H7igOHGlp4/maxresdefault.jpg",
      "Their contacts are usually listed on the scholarship program website or on their social networks.\nDon't write to the media people, they probably have too many messages to read themselves and it would be quicker to contact a manager.\nDon't forget that at the end of the day, it's not the facts and figures that will decide, but the manager's attitude toward you. So at the very least, show respect and patience."

      "https://img.youtube.com/vi/4H7igOHGlp4/maxresdefault.jpg",
      "Communicating on Twitter looks more natural, communicating with Scholars directly and simply, like with friends. For example, start with a message like this:\nHey I am new to the axie community and wanted to learn more about your scholarship program. Thanks.\nThis type of message makes you much more willing to help than the usual spam. Also, other members may see your message and recommend you to your manager, which will greatly increase your chances."

      "Use scholar names or nicknames",
      "https://img.youtube.com/vi/4H7igOHGlp4/maxresdefault.jpg",
      "If you want to reach a particular scholar manager, you should add his or her name or nickname at the beginning of the message, for example:\nHey Bryce I am new to the axie community and wanted to learn more about your scholarship program. Thanks.\nPeople sense right away if you copy and paste text wherever you want without making any changes. They are people just like you, if you want to find out any information about them, you should address them by name, so that they feel that you spent some time on it."
